# Placement-Preparation Guide
This guide is all about what i prepared for my placements. Reason for creating is to not only help other's who could be benefited from it but also for my self so if in future i want to prepare i know where to go.

### üöÄ **Overview**
Welcome to my placement preparation guide! This repository serves as a comprehensive collection of my preparation for technical interviews, focusing on **Data Structures & Algorithms**, **Computer Science Fundamentals**, and **Projects**.

## üìÇ **Data Structures & Algorithms**

I will guide as per my experience - 

Learning - i followed love babbar for a good time till linkedlist, also went through gfg self paced course, than rest of the topics were covered through Striver's playlist like dp, trees, graphs etc.

            Things to keep in mind is not only watch videos but try to give your input means try yourself problem being discussed.

        Things i would have changed is stick to one teacher initially, follow some book or blogs about topics i am learning currently.
        Try to understand what is done and why it is done.

        Be patient it may take you more time but be consistent sooner or latter you will get better.

Practicing - After leaning about an algo or a data structure, first thing to do is practice standard problem's of it. I followed Striver aToZ sheet amazing resource and yes there are many other sheet's as well.
             After practicing standard i would try to draw some observation regarding the problems i solved some pattern's which help me to identify in which kind of situation or problem this algo/ds is used.
             This would be enough for interviews but for contest's and for hard interview we have to go a step furthur.
             
             Covering as much variety 
             + increasing difficulty (it can be acceptance rate) 
             + Time bound practice will take you to another level of problem solving.

             
Competing - just couple of things :- 

            Give as many coding contest - codeforce, leetcode, codechef, gfg, atcoder, code360 ....
            Do up solve 1 to 2 questions ( this is where learning will happen )
            Give you best don't attach youself to rating it takes good 5 to 6 months to see improvement.

## üíª **Computer Science Fundamentals**

This section outlines the core CS concepts I have learnt, resources i followed.

OOPS - gfg articles is a gold mine.
       Faraz sheet is good to watch out.
       Past interview experiences / recent questions.

Os - Love babbar code help playlist.
     Past interview experiences / recent questions.

DBMS - love babbar code help playlist.
       SQL leetcode 
       Past interview experiences / recent questions.

CN - just read a couple of important blog's on gfg like osi layer, tcp/ip layer.


      Tips- If you have time then do it in depth, make your own notes.
            Keep revising + some focus on numericals will be helpful in oa.

### **Topics Covered:**
- **Operating Systems (OS)**
    - Processes and Threads | Memory Management | Deadlocks
- **Computer Networks (CN)**
    - TCP/IP Protocols | OSI Model | HTTP, HTTPS
- **Databases (DBMS)**
    - SQL vs NoSQL | ACID Properties | Indexing & Normalization
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
    - Encapsulation | Inheritance | Polymorphism | Design Patterns

## üõ†Ô∏è **Projects**

Have project on resumes which u know very well and can explain. 
Can find a problem statement and solve it. 

I built 2 project's which were real world problem statement oriented and had real world users.

Give proper time when you are learning any developmental tech stack.

## **Interview prep**

It is very important to have a good introduction and communication skills. 
Give some mock interviews to get comfortable with being interviewed.


        Last be overprepared and keep preparing till you don't achieve what u want.
        Keep your calm, stay in touch with loved ones.
        All the best.
